        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cuscuz is a traditional northeastern brazilian dish, which at its core is a simple steamed cake made from hydrated corn flakes (flocão) resulting in a uniquely fluffy, moist and crumbly texture. When cooked correctly in a specialized steamer called a cuscuzeira, it emerges piping hot, fragrant, and ready to absorb whatever savory or sweet topping you pair with it. It is the quintessential breakfast, but substantial enough for dinner, acting as a versatile canvas for the region's bold flavors. </p>

        <p>The origins of this dish are a fascinating culinary intersection. It traces back to the  Berbers of North Africa (who brought the steaming technique to Portugal), but upon arriving in Brazil, colonizers adapted the method to the abundant native ingredient: corn. It became a staple food due to its low cost, high energy, and ease of preparation. Today in places like Pernambuco, the smell of cuscuz steaming is the universal alarm clock. It is democratic and beloved, eaten by everyone from the humblest worker to the wealthiest landowner, often served simply with a generous pat of butter melting into its yellow crevices, or dressed up with the sun-dried beef and cheese.</p>

        
        <h2>Essential Equipment</h2>
        <p>A <strong>cuscuzeira</strong> the specific steaming pot shaped like an hourglass (image below) is needed if you want to make the dish the traditional way. If you don't have one, you can improvise with a steamer basket and a pot, but the cuscuzeira is the standard.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>The protein</h3>

                <h3>The Dairy</h3>
                <p>Slices of <em>Queijo Coalho</em> (squeaky cheese) or warm milk poured over the crumbled cuscuz (making it "Cuscuz com Leite").</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Hydration <strong>(The Most Important Step)</strong></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Mix Dry</h4>
                        <p>In a large bowl, place the corn flakes (flocão) and the salt. If you are using the optional tapioca starch, mix it in now.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Add Water</h4>
                        <p>Slowly pour the water over the flakes while stirring with you hand or a spoon. You want the mixturre to feel like damp sand, enough to clump together if you squeeze it, but still easily crumbling apart. <strong>Do not turn it into a soup.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The Rest</h4>
                        <p>Cover the bowl with a cloth or plate and let it rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Why?</em> The corn flakes need to absorb the water to swell and softer. If you skip this, your cuscuz will be dry and gritty.</p>
                             </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Preparing the Cuscuzeira</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Fill Water</h4>
                        <p>Fill the bottom compartment of the cuscuzeira with water (about halfway up the bottom chamber). Make sure the water level does not touch the perforated steamer plate where the corn will sit.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Assemble</h4>
                        <p>Place the perforated divider/plate into the pot.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Filling the Pot</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Fluff and Fill</h4>
                        <p>After the resting time, give the corn mixture one last stir to fluff it up. Gently spoon the mixture in the top chamber of the cuscuzeira.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Don't Press</h4>
                        <p><strong>This is a crucial rule</strong> <em>do not</em> pack or press the corn down tightly. Keep it loose and airy so the steam can circulate through the grains.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Level Off</h4>
                        <p>Gently level the top with a spoon without compressing it. Cover with the lid.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            </li>

                <h3>Steaming</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cook</h4>
                        <p>Place the pot on the stove over medium heat</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The Smell Test</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Expert Tip:</em> you will know it is ready by the smell. A distinct, sweet aroma of cooked corn (similar to popcorn or tamales) will fill the kitchen. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serving</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Unmold</h4>
                        <p>Turn off the heat. Carefully remove the lid. You can serve it by scooping it out with a spoon, or, for a beautiful presentation, place a plate over the top and flip the pot to unmold the cuscuz as a single cake.</p>
                        
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Butter Immediately</h4>
                        <p>While it is still steaming hot, apply a generous amount of butter so it melts and soaks into the corn.</p>
                    </li>
                    

                </ol>
