        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Feijoada (pronounced fey-joou-ah-dah) is the most traditional national dish of Brazil. At its core it is a slow-cooked black beans stew, alongside a assortment of flavorful pork and sometimes beef cuts. Unlike a simple bean soup, the feijoada completa includes smoked sausages like linguiça and paio, along with salted and cured cuts such as ham hocks and bacon, all traditionally accompanied by bright white rice, crunchy toasted manioc flour, collard greens and sliced oranges.</p>

        <p>This hearty dish is a perfect reflection of Brazil's diverse history and cultural fusion. While the concept of a meat and bean stew has roots in Portuguese cuisine, the use of black beans and the distinctly rich, communal style of preparation evolved during the colonial era, often attributed to the ingenuity of enslaved Africans who adapted inexpensive cuts of meat into the dish. What was once sustenance to the oppressed with time became a celebratory tradition, bringing families together on Saturday afternoon around the same delicious food. Follow the steps to make it yourself.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preparation (the day before)</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Soak the Beans</h4>
                        <p>Rinse the black beans and place them in a large bowl. Cover with plenty of fresh water and let them soak overnight (8-12 hours). <em>Drain and rinse before cooking.</em></p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Desalt the Meats</h4>
                        <p>Place the salted meats (like the dried beef) in a separate bowl. Cover with water and let them soak overnight. <em>Change the water 2-3 times</em> during the soaking process to draw out the excess salt.</p>
                         <br>
                    </li>
                   
                </ol>
            </li>
    
            <li><strong>Pre-Cooking the Meats</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Parboil Meats</h4>

                        <p>Place the pre-soaked salted meats and the smoked pork ribs/shoulder/hocks (but not the bacon or sausages yet) in a large pot. Cover with fresh water, bring to a boil, and let them cook for about 10-15 minutes. This helps clean them and removes any remaining excess salts. Drain well.</p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Combine & Start</h4>
                        <p>Place the drained beans, all the pre-cooked meats (ribs, hocks, shoulder, etc...) and the 3 bay leaves into a large, heavy-bottomed pot (a Dutch oven is ideal). Cover with at least 2 inches of fresh water.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Long Simmer</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>First Simmer</h4>
                        <p>Bring the bean and meat mixture to a strong boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. The beans should be starting to soften, and the meats should be very tender.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Add Sausages</h4>
                        <p>After the first simmer, add the sliced smoked and paio sausages to the pot. Continue to simmer, covered, for another 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Building the Flavor Base (Temperagem)</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sauté Aromatics</h4>
                        <p>While the stew continues its final simmer, prepare the seasoning base. In a separate small skillet, heat the olive oil or lard over medium heat. Add the cubed bacon and cook until crispy.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Aromatics</h4>
                        <p>Add the chopped onion to the skillet and cook until translucent. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant <strong>(do not let the garlic burn).</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Combine</h4>
                        <p>Carefully transfer the entire contents of the skillet into the large pot of beans and meat. Stir well to combine.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Final Seasoning and Finishing</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Thickening and Seasoning</h4>
                        <p>Continue to simmer the feijoada, now uncovered, for about 30 minutes. The mixture should thicken naturally as the beans break down and the broth reduces.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Taste and Adjust</h4>
                        <p>Now is the time to taste the stew. Because the meats are salty, you may not need much, if any, salt. Add black pepper and salt to taste, If you are using the orange peel, add it now (and remove just before serving).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Rest</h4>
                        <p>The secret to truly great feijoada is letting the flavors meld. Turn off the head and let the stew rest for at least 30 minutes before serving.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
